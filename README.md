Introduction to BASH workshop (January 12, 2022) video is now available on YouTube for you to watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VUynJ_CBJo

Based on the feedbacks received from participants, I also made a quick BASH supplemental video tutorials on the following topics which we couldn't cover in detail due to limited time.

1) How to install and set-up Linux virtual machine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7oSFv1lZIA)

2) How to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux and set-up Ubuntu terminal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAIMD_NpXCk)

3) Linux vs WSL and how to install minimap2 on both systems (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm6CQ9tIvqU)

Please note that supplementary videos are only provided for Intro to BASH session because this workshop should provide enough foundation for beginners to follow along in the next upcoming workshops.
